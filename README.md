# Test system
This is a small simple program that I wrote a long time ago to learn how to work with PostresSQL API, JSON format and FLTK library. 
There many hard-coded values and some smelly code, so be warned. Also there's no client/server relationship, so all database is in dbexport.

## What I learned in this project:
- How to work with PostgreSQL API (libpq)
- How to work with JSON format by using nlohmann_json library
- How to build simple UI by using FLTK library
